I've been working with Vue and Vuex for over 16 months, but React has always been the library of my loves, so I decided to start a short project with React, Redux and TypeScript to refresh my knowledge.

_I have never been in favor of using TS on the frontend, it seems unnecessary to me, but hey, it is the subject of another conversation._

I decided to create my project using _Create React App_ using the Redux-TypeScript template, but I came across unexpected news; Redux has changed dramatically since I last used it.

I had to start reading the official documentation again, luckily I came across a great example that I decided to save here.

**Redux**

```js
import { createStore } from "redux"

/**
 * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an
 * action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
 * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
 *
 * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.
 * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,
 * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.
 */
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "counter/incremented":
      return { value: state.value + 1 }
    case "counter/decremented":
      return { value: state.value - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counterReducer)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/incremented" })
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/incremented" })
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/decremented" })
// {value: 1}
```

**Redux Toolkit**

```js
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: {
    value: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    incremented: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decremented: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
  },
})

export const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterSlice.reducer,
})

// Can still subscribe to the store
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch(incremented())
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch(decremented())
// {value: 1}
```

According to the theory, RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including store setup, creating reducers and writing immutable update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once.

I'll have to give it a try, redux always seemed tremendously complex to me.

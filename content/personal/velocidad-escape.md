It has been a long time since the last time I wrote a post here, however, now that I have a little more free time I plan to resume writing. I hope this post is short.

I want to tell you where the inspiration for the name of this blog came from...

Since I was a child I have always been very interested in astronomy, however I never saw it possible to study something related in a third world country. However, that is not the story...

One day, very normal in the life of every university student (I think) I went to the library, because I needed a bit of calm in my head, so I sat in an armchair near the "New acquisitions" section, I'm not a person who usually reads literature, I have never really been able to become a bookworm, I get distracted very easily, despite that, a book caught my attention because of its strange cover: **Velocidad de Escape. La cibercultura en el final del siglo.** I could only think of something: Astronomy and technology in one book? Wow! Amazing!!!

The introduction of the book is beautiful, basically in it **Mark Dery** perfectly summarizes what he will talk about in the following 349 pages...

> La velocidad de escape es la velocidad en la que un cuerpo vence la atracción gravitatoria de otro cuerpo, como por ejemplo una nave espacial cuando abandona la Tierra. La cultura de los ordenadores, o cibercultura, parece estar cada vez más cerca de ese límite en el que logrará alcanzar la velocidad de escape.

I really don't have much more to add, I just wanted to tell you where the name of the blog comes from, maybe someone will end up interested and end up reading the book.
